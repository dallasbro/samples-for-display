	<h3>Hello and welcome to the Broyles' Camping Year for 2010.</h3> 
	<p> I, Craig Broyles, recently took an HTML course in college and had to develop a website for a
	 final project.  So I thought I would take the time and build it about something I was interested in.
	  Camping with friends and family.</p> 
	<p>Throughout the course I learned many things like developing style sheets both internal and external,
	as well as, building web tables, web forms and inline frames.</p>
	<p>The <a href="home.htm">Home</a> page (current page) is an introduction to the site.   At the top you will see links to other 
	pages within the site.   The <a href="campdates.htm">Camp Dates</a> page inludes a web table of a calendar which has the dates of all 
	of our planned camping trips for the 2010 season.  The <a href="links.htm">Links</a> page provides links to the camping locations
	and places of interest in the area.  The <a href="rallysignup.htm">Rally with Us</a> page displays a web form that lets us know you 
	are planning to meet us at a specific location so we can make proper campsite arrangements.   I hope you
	enjoy the website and I hope to rally with you this camping season.</p>
